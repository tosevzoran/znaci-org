<p>PREFACE</p>
<p>In the following story of the establishment of Tito's supply lines across the Adriatic fictitious names have been assigned to some of the characters, but the characters them­selves are portrayed exactly as they seemed to the author.</p>
<p>Virtually no other departure from meticulous accuracy has been made in this narrative, which covers a period of four eventful weeks, a period in which felicitous circumstances and the loyal help of many British and American officers of all ranks, not excepting Admirals and Generals, made possible the accomplishment of an important mission.</p>
<p>The story is not complete. There were difficulties of all sorts in addition to those recorded here. Sometimes our effec­tiveness was impaired by lack of understanding or ill will, but our true friends were legion. With their assistance our pur­poses prevailed.</p>
<p>Nothing has been added to the record.</p>
<p>This is how it was. . . .</p>
